This is my 3-weeks intern project.
In this project, I focused on retrieving data from OSI PI server, creating a modern and interactive UI for user to visualize and analyze. OSI PI server belongs to OSI PI sytem - an database infrastructure designed specifically for industry, allows users to analyze, manage, query the data
I used Visual Studio (C#, WPF), PISDK, Livecharts and some other libraries to implement the project.
